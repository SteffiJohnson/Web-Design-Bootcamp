                    <h1>Ultimate Ears Boom 3 Is The Most Stylish Bluetooth Speaker Around</h1>

                        A good Bluetooth speaker needs to do three things: sound great, provide good enough battery life, and not look embarrassing. The Boom 3 from Ultimate Ears definitely hits those marks. 
                        At $149.99, the Boom 3 isn't a huge bargain, but you do get what you pay for. This is a swanky-looking Bluetooth speaker with plenty of customization options, simple setup, and, well, booming sound.<br> 
                        <br>The Boom 3 is unique among Bluetooth speakers in that its appearance might be the most distinctive thing about it. It's a perfect cylinder, standing at 7.8 inches tall with bases that measure 2.8 inches in diameter. There's a clear top and bottom side, with the top including a Bluetooth pairing button, what Ultimate Ears calls the "Magic Touch" button for playback controls in the middle, and a power button. Astoundingly massive volume controls sit on the speaker grill itself, while a microUSB charging port is hidden near the bottom side.
                        <br> There's also a little loop behind the top side that's theoretically for hanging the speaker from things. That's about it for physical features, as the Boom 3 is remarkably stripped down and straightforward. Its speaker grill wraps around the entire cylinder, beaming out sound from a pair of two-inch drivers and a couple of two-by-four-inch passive radiators.  <br>
                        <br> Ultimate Ears sent me an almost entirely purple unit, which I am way into. This is a pretty awesome looking speaker, all things considered. It can get even more awesome with a frankly absurd amount of customization options on the company website. You can order a Boom 3 with a cheetah-print speaker grill and different colors on every individual element, from the bases to the volume buttons to the spine on the back.  <br>
                        <br> It's rare for a Bluetooth speaker to be a conversation piece, but if you want to show up to the park, beach, or pool with the most ludicrous speaker in town, that's what it'll be. I love that. <br>
                        <br>As for setup, there isn't really much to say. It's almost as simple as can be: Hold the Bluetooth pairing button, find the Boom 3 in your device's Bluetooth menu, and you're all set. You also have the option of working through an Android and iOS app for some bonus features like equalizer controls for audiophiles, but it's not strictly necessary. From there, you can also check battery life and rename the speaker. <br>
                        <br> It only takes a handful of moments for the Ultimate Ears Boom 3 to go from being a paperweight to being the life of the party. Pairing is easy, the mobile app knows when to help and when to stay out of the way, and the sound quality is excellent. Not only that, but nobody nearby will feel left out thanks to its 360-degree sound. <br>
                        <br> All of that adds up to an excellent hangout companion, with truly outstanding battery life. There are some caveats, as the mobile app can only link to Spotify on Android and horizontal placement doesn't do the Boom 3 any favors. But whether you're gathering around a fireplace in the winter or expending all your pent up energy at the beach during the summer, the Ultimate Ears Boom 3 speaker won't disappoint. <br>
