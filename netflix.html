                    <h1>Netflix 'Play Something' Feature Being Tested For Android App!</h1>
                    <img src = "images/netflix.webp" alt = "">
                    <p class="para">Good news for all Android users out there! Do you know the feature on Netflix that helps you decide which show to watch? The feature is called ‘Play Something’ and it was released for TVs last month. Now, there are reports that the feature is being tested for the Netflix app on Android. <br>
                        <br>The feature was spotted by Engadget and it reveals that Android users are seeing the ‘Play Something’ button on the home screen or when choosing profiles (both Kid’s and Adult) on the Netflix Android app. The button acts as a shuffle and randomly picks a show or movie for you to watch depending on your preferences and show recommendations. <br>
                        <br>This comes in really handy at times when you’re having a hard time deciding which show or movie you should watch. Also, if you don’t like the movie or TV show that the feature picks, you can keep using it again and again. <br>
                        <br>In other Netflix-related news, a new malware was discovered on Google Play Store in an app that was a fake version of Netflix. The app is called “FlixOnline” and claimed to offer users two months of “premium” Netflix access for free. <br>
                        <br>Google soon removed the app as it could have allowed hackers to launch phishing attacks and steal personal user data from their WhatsApp accounts. However, before removing it from the Play Store, users had downloaded the app over 500 times. Additionally, it was also recently reported that Netflix might also soon introduce video games with an Xbox Game pass-like service. <br>
